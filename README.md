```bash
mkdir data_store
mkdir checkpoints
mkdir logs_result
```
### Cifar100
Please refer to https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html for downloading Cifar100.

### Imagenet 1k
Please refer to https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php for downloading the Imagenet 1k.

## Example Experiments on Cifar100
We provide training and evaluation experiment configurations for Cifar100 in <code>./configs</code>. The following commands are training experiments from ResNet50 to ResNet50 (with data change of 50 classes to 100 classes).

### Train and Eval script
```bash
bash run_train_eval.sh
```   

The results are saved in <code>logs_result</code> folder.
